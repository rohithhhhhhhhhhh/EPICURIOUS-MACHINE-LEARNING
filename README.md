# EPICURIOUS-MACHINE-LEARNING

Epicurious Recipe Classification:

Project Overview:

This project explores the Epicurious Recipe Dataset using data visualization and machine learning techniques to classify recipes into distinct categories.

Dataset:

- Source: Epicurious Recipe Dataset
- Features: Ingredients, Cooking Time, Ratings, etc.
- Target Variable: Recipe Category (Dessert, Main Course, etc.)

Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing ingredient frequency, cooking time distribution, and recipe category proportions.
3. Modeling: Comparison of 7 machine learning algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Naive Bayes
    - Random Forest
    - AdaBoost
    - Decision Tree
4. Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Classification Reports.

Results:

- Comparison Graph: Visualizing model performances.
- Classification Reports: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Support for each category.

Models used:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Naive Bayes
5. Random Forest
6. AdaBoost
7. Decision Tree
